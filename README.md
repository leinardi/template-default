# template-default

Default @leinardi repository template: the scaffolding every `leinardi/*` repository shares, before any language or stack is
added.

## What it contains

- **Tooling:** a Makefile on [make-common](https://github.com/leinardi/make-common) (`make check`, `make pre-commit-install`,
  `make help`), and a pre-commit config with the core hooks, checkmake, actionlint, markdownlint, shellcheck, prettier for YAML,
  yamllint, and `conventional-pre-commit` on `commit-msg` with `--force-scope`.
- **CI:** the reviewdog jobs from
  [gha-pre-commit-reviewdog-actions](https://github.com/leinardi/gha-pre-commit-reviewdog-actions), which comment on pull
  requests, and a `conventional-commits` job that checks every commit of a pull request. The pre-commit cache warm-up runs on
  `main` when the hook config changes.
- **Release:** a **Release** workflow on
  [`simple-tag-and-release`](https://github.com/leinardi/gh-reusable-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/simple-tag-and-release.md):
  the version is optional and derived from the commits when empty, with a dry run.
- **GitHub:** dependabot for the actions and the hooks, CODEOWNERS, a pull request template, and issue templates with blank issues
  off and a link to the security policy.
- **Docs:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and an `adversarial-review`
  skill in `.agents/skills/` (symlinked as `.claude/skills`).

Every action and reusable workflow is pinned by commit SHA, with the version in a comment; dependabot keeps them current.

## After creating a repository from this template

1. Replace `template-default` everywhere it names this repository: `git grep -n template-default` lists every place, including
   the security link in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`.
2. Rewrite this README and the "What this is" and "Layout" sections of `AGENTS.md` for the project.
3. Add a `LICENSE`. The template has none on purpose: the repositories do not all use the same one.
4. Add the stack, following the repository closest to it (e.g. swarm-scheduler-exporter for Go, adversarial-review-loop for
   Python):
    - its pre-commit hooks, and the matching reviewdog and test jobs in `ci.yaml`;
    - its dependabot ecosystem, with the `fix(deps)` prefix for dependencies that ship with a release and `chore(deps)` for the
      rest;
    - make-common snippets in `MK_COMMON_FILES`, and project targets in a local `.mk/<name>.mk` listed in `MK_LOCAL_FILES`,
      never as recipes in the Makefile;
    - its sections in `.editorconfig` and `.prettierignore`.
5. Keep, extend or delete `release.yaml`: pass `artifact_name` to attach built files, replace it with a stack-specific release
   (e.g. swarm-scheduler-exporter's for images and binaries), or delete it, and the release sections of the docs, if the project
   never releases. The first release needs an explicit version, since there is no tag to derive it from.
6. Tailor the invariants and the verification gates of `.agents/skills/adversarial-review/SKILL.md`.
7. Run `make pre-commit-install`, then `make check`.
8. Add the repository to gh-leinardi-iac, with `conventional-commits` among its required checks, and enable private
   vulnerability reporting, which `SECURITY.md` points to.
