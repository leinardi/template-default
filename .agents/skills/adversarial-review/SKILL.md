  Adversarial code review of a set of changes to template-default, the default leinardi/*
  repository template — working tree, staged diff, a branch vs main, a commit range, or a PR.
  Hunts for workflow permission and injection problems, unpinned actions, shell recipes that
  break on unusual input, commit types that ship the wrong release, and docs that no longer
  match the code, then reports ranked findings. Use when the user asks to review changes/a
  diff/a PR/a branch, "check my work before committing", "is this ready to merge", or "poke
  holes in this".

# Adversarial Review — template-default

You are a hostile reviewer. Assume the change is **wrong until proven right**. Find the input,
state or event where it breaks. A review that finds nothing is only credible after you tried to
break it and failed.

Copy this checklist and tick items as you go:

```text
Review progress:
- [ ] 1. Diff and intent established (default scope if none given)
- [ ] 2. AGENTS.md and the contracts it names read
- [ ] 3. Repository invariants checked
- [ ] 4. Adversarial passes run
- [ ] 5. Findings confirmed or dropped; gates run
- [ ] 6. Report written
```

## 1. Establish the diff

With no scope given, review the uncommitted work; if the tree is clean, review the branch
against `main`.

| User intent | Command |
| --- | --- |
| "my work" / uncommitted | `git status`, then `git diff HEAD`; read untracked files too |
| staged changes only | `git diff --staged` |
| a branch / "this PR" | `git diff main...HEAD` |
| a commit range | `git diff <base>..<head>` |
| a GitHub PR number | `gh pr diff <n>` and `gh pr view <n>` |

Read every changed file in full, not just the hunks, and the files that call or document it.

## 2. Load project authority

Read `AGENTS.md` first: its conventions are the review checklist's floor, and `README.md` is the
user-facing contract a change must keep true.

## 3. Repository invariants — check on every review

### Workflows

- Every action and reusable workflow is pinned by full commit SHA, with the version in a
  trailing comment that matches the SHA. A tag or branch ref is a finding.
- Top-level `permissions: contents: read`; a job that needs more says so on the job, and no
  more than it uses. A write permission on a job that runs pull-request code is **critical**.
- No `${{ }}` expression inlined in a `run:` script or a `github-script` body: it goes through
  `env:`. Inlined attacker-controlled values (titles, branch names, commit messages, inputs) are
  script injection, **critical**.
- A job gated on `github.event_name == 'pull_request'` must not be a required check that other
  events need to report.
- A release or other writing workflow refuses to run from anything but the default branch.

### Shell and make

- Quoting: paths with spaces, empty variables, `$$` escaping in make recipes, a `\` continuation
  on every line of a multi-line recipe.
- Failure: `set -euo pipefail` in scripts; a step that exits 0 after a failed command (`;`
  instead of `&&`, a pipeline without `pipefail`, `|| true` that hides a real error).
- New targets live in a local `.mk/*.mk` listed in `MK_LOCAL_FILES`, never in the Makefile; a
  fetched `.mk` file edited by hand is lost on the next `make mk-common-update`.

### Commits and releases

- Every commit is `type(scope): subject`. The type decides the release: a change that should
  ship is a `fix` or a `feat`, a breaking one has `!`; a `chore` or `refactor` that changes
  behaviour ships nothing. Merge commits keep every commit, so check each one.

## 4. Adversarial passes

- **Correctness:** a default that changes what an existing user gets.
- **Empty and edge input:** unset optional inputs, a repository with no tags, an empty list, a
  first run, a re-run after a partial failure.
- **Contract drift:** README, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template still describe
  what the repository does.

For each candidate finding, reproduce it or trace the failing input end to end. If that confirms
it, report it; if not, dig once more, then drop it. No named input and wrong result, no finding.

## 5. Verify

| Diff touched | Run |
| --- | --- |
| anything | `make check` |
| a workflow | `make check` (actionlint), then reason through each trigger it has: pull request, push, dispatch |

Say which gates you could not run rather than implying they passed.

## 6. Report

Rank worst first:

```text
<path>:<line> — <severity: critical | high | medium | low>: <one-line defect>
  Failure: <the concrete input/state → the wrong result or broken invariant>
  Fix: <the specific change>
```

End with a verdict: **block**, **approve with nits**, or **approve**, and the gates you ran.
